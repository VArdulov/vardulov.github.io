Welcome to my site!
======

Welcome to a collection and presentation of some of my most recent works. I'm currently a PhD student in the Signal Analysis and Interpretation Lab (SAIL) under the advisement of Dr. Shrikanth Narayanan at the University of Southern California (USC).

My interests lie, in understanding interpersonal influences, specifically during dyadic and multi-agent interactions. I believe with the correct observations and priors, we can construct models that have far reaching diagnostic and therapeutic implications.

In my spare time, I am a triathlete, in-door boulder-er(?), and fan of the San Jose Sharks. I can also be frequently found at preppy coffee shops, and classical music concerts.

Feel free to explore, and stay tuned for more blog entries!
