**Description**: Described is a system for learning and predicting key phrases. The system learns based on a dataset of historical forecasting questions, their associated time-series data for a quantity of interest, and associated keyword sets. The system learns the optimal policy of actions to take given the associated keyword sets and the optimal set of keywords which are predictive of the quantity of interest. Given a new forecasting question, the system extracts an initial keyword set from a new forecasting question, which are perturbed to generate an optimal predictive key-phrase set. Key-phrase time-series data are extracted for the optimal predictive key-phrase set, which are used to generate a forecast of future values for a value of interest. The forecast can be used for a variety of purposes, such as advertising online.
