**Description**: An image with a known, first classification by the machine learning model is received. This image is then iteratively modified using at least one perturbation algorithm and such modified images are input into the machine learning model until such time as the machine learning model outputs a second classification different from the first classification. Data characterizing the modifications to the image that resulted in the second classification can be provided (eg, displayed in a GUI, loaded into memory, stored in physical persistence, transmitted to a remote computing device). Related apparatus, systems, techniques and articles are also described.
