Class covered fundamentals of AI starting from deterministic search-algorithms going to heuristic functions, statistical
learning methods, eventually building up towards the basics of neural based approaches. Duties encompassed preparing 
programming assignments, writing solutions to homework and exams, monitoring student question and discussion board, and 
leading weekly discussion sections providing additional support and exploring tangential topics beyond those covered in
class. This was a particularly challenging teaching experience as it occured during the early stages of COVID-19 and the
instructor was new to the course, so we had to be creative, adaptive, and compassionate as we navigated the course and topics.
